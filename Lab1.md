Objective: To create files and directories using the touch and mkdir commands.

1. Create empty files

Use the touch command to create the files in one line:

This command creates:

song1.mp3 to song6.mp3

snap1.jpg to snap6.jpg

film1.avi to film6.avi


2. Create multiple directories at once

Use the mkdir command to create all three directories at once:

This creates three directories: friends, family, and work.
